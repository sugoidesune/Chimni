<div class="modal" id="myModal" ... >

 */

$(document).ready(function() {

  if(window.location.href.indexOf('#subscribed') != -1) {
    $('#portfolioModal1').modal('show');
  }

});

/*
Then you can send people to http://www.website.com/page.html#myModal and it'll load the page with the modal open.
